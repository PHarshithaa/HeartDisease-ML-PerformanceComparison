## HeartDisease-ML-PerformanceComparison

Heart disease is a major global health issue, so early diagnosis is important for better outcomes and reducing healthcare demands.                          
Predicting the risk of heart disease is complex due to various factors such as age, lifestyle, and genetics, but effective prediction can lead to timely and targeted interventions.

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using various machine learning models based on different health metrics.
